<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 26 year old male from Guatemala and currently living in the US.</p>

<p>
  I've always been fascinated by techlogy and thats's why I chose to become a
  developer.
</p>

<p>
  One day I will have my own tech company and one of my biggest dreams it's to
  travel around the globe.
